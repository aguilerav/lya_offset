# Lyman Alpha offset

## Abstract
The accurate of the cosmological distances is crucial in the understanding of the observational cosmology. Since spectroscopy of distant sources is hard to obtain in most cases we rely only in the photometry to obtain redshifts of cosmological objects. Using data from the Michigan/Magellan Fiber System (M2FS) spectrograph and the MUSE integral field spectrograph, we have found a systematic offset between the photometric redshift of Lyman alpha emitters and their corresponding spectroscopic redshift at 3 < z < 6.0. This offset can directly affect our ability to obtain other properties of the distant galaxies. Here we provide an analysis how the flux excess of the Lyman alpha line affects the photometric redshifts. We used data of 254 galaxies in the extragalactic survey fields: COSMOS, UKIDSS-UDS and GOODSS-South. Every object is in the 3DHST/CANDELS survey which provides wide broadband data in order to calculate the photometric redshifts. For the spectroscopic redshift we use the Lya redshift found with the spectrographs. When the Lya flux is subtracted from the affected filters the photometric redshifts are consistent with the spectroscopic redshifts. This must be taken into account when observing Lya emitters and no spectroscopic information is available.
